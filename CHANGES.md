# TweakScale Companion :: Kerbal Inventory System (KIS) :: Changes

* 2021-1010: 1.0.0.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.3.0
	+ TSCo-KIS goes gold!!! **#HURRAY!!**
	+ Refactoring using the new KSPe.Light.TweakScale v2.4 facilities to allow it to be safely installed on rigs without it.
		+ Lots of flexibility on packaging in the near future
	+ Raises the bar to 1.3.0 (something is not coping well on KSP > 1.10, apparently something related to `KSPField`)
