# TweakScale Companion :: Kerbal Inventory & Attachment Systems (KIAS) :: Changes

* 2022-0502: 1.0.0.2 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.3.0
	+ Fixes a NRE that was happening due the new TweakScale's "Upgrade Pipeline".
	+ Closes issues:
		- [#5](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScaleCompanion_KIS/issues/5) NRE when TweakScale dispatches OnRescale after upgrading a Scale Type that was changed on some patch 
* 2021-1010: 1.0.0.0 (LisiasT) for KSP >= 1.3.0
	+ TSCo-KIS goes gold!!! **#HURRAY!!**
	+ Refactoring using the new KSPe.Light.TweakScale v2.4 facilities to allow it to be safely installed on rigs without it.
		+ Lots of flexibility on packaging in the near future
	+ Raises the bar to 1.3.0 (something is not coping well on KSP > 1.10, apparently something related to `KSPField`)
